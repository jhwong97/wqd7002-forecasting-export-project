# Forecasting Malaysia's Total Export Value with Machine Learning Regression Models

## Research Objectives
1. To conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the relationship between world's total export value, US dollar to Malaysian Ringgit (USRMYR) exchange rate, real broad effective exchange rate (RBEER), Malaysia's total export and import value.
2. To develop predictive models using both statistical models and machine learning regression models in forecasting Malaysia's total export value and evaluate the models' performance.
3. To provide recommendations in improving the results of future research works related to forecasting international trade of a country.

A brief introduction on the research workflow adopted:

- **Business Understanding** phase: Critical for achieving the objectives by involving a deep analysis of the economic indicators, machine learning techniques and data selection via extensive literature review to understand international trade concepts, Malaysia's trade history, modeling techniques, and variables influencing Malaysia's total export value.
- **Data Understanding** phase: Encompasses several processes to gain a comprehesive understanding into the chosen datasets intended for both exploratory analysis and modeling. In this research, five key processes of data understanding have been implemented: **data collection**, **data description**, **data quality assessment**, **data exploration** and **data relationships**.
- **Data Preparation** phase: Focuses on feature engineering processes - **variable selection**, **conversion to stationary data** and **data transformation** to ensure the attributes/variables from the dataset are compatible for EDA and modelling purposes.
- **Modelling** phase: Implements statistical methods (**ARIMA** & **SARIMA**) and machine learning regression methods (**Random Forest**, **Linear Regression**, **Gradient Boosting** & **Support Vector Regressor**) to develop predictive models in forecasting Malaysia's total export value.
- **Evaluation** phase: Evaluates the models' performance based on two performance metrics - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** and **R-squared value (R<sup>2</sup>)**.
